### Introduction

The next two course sessions will be drawn from the new online book "[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)" (aka "r4ds"), by Garret Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

[Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) is a legend in the R community. He's the primary developer of `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and a slug of other R packages that are collectively known (and installable) as the **tidyverse**. These packages enable a style of scientific programming that's (usually) much more readable and easier to learn than "standard" R.

### Data wrangling part 1 --- importing and tidying

- [1.4.3 The tidyverse](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#the-tidyverse)
    - Don't worry if you get a
```
cannot open URL 'https://.../PACKAGES.rds'
```
    message from `install.packages`. Go ahead and try
```
library(tidyverse)
```
    ---it will probably work.
